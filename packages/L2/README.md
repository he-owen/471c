# L2 Language

L2 is an intermediate language that decodes some of the high levels functions of L3. Still maintains much of the previous abstractions. 

## Differences from L3:
- LetRec was removed and replaced with Let. Functions are now defined using Let and can be recursive by referencing themselves.
